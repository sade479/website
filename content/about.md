Hello, my name is Tanim Pavel and this is my website where I document new material that I am learning about.
I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

This website is hosted using Caddy, a web server with automatic HTTPS running on a Linux cloud server.
